# Flexible Process Management for Iterative Adjustments

## Purpose
To provide a framework for managing flexible processes that require iterative adjustments and intuitive decision-making.

## Scope
This rule applies to any process requiring adaptive management and iterative improvements, particularly where exact specifications may not be predetermined.

## Guidelines

1. Initial Setup
   - Gather necessary items selectively
   - Position items in their preliminary locations
   - Avoid over-collecting; focus on essential elements

2. Assessment and Sorting
   - Sort items based on intuitive feedback
   - Identify and set aside items showing resistance
   - Make initial adjustments to main components

3. Implementation Process
   - Execute primary adjustments with measured force
   - Allow for natural settling periods between actions
   - Perform periodic checks during the waiting period
   - Make incremental adjustments based on observations

4. Feedback and Adjustment
   - Monitor for signs of process progression
   - Listen for auditory indicators of change
   - Implement improvisational solutions as needed
   - Maintain flexibility in approach

5. Completion and Verification
   - Perform reverse motions to stabilize changes
   - Allow brief settling period
   - Assess final state against initial conditions
   - Iterate previous steps if needed

## Examples

1. Correct Process Flow:
   - Gather essential items
   - Position preliminarily
   - Make gentle adjustments
   - Wait and observe
   - Make final stabilizing adjustments
   - Verify changes

2. Adjustment Scenario:
   - When expected changes aren't observed
   - Return to earlier process steps
   - Trust in gradual progression
   - Allow process to develop naturally

## Compliance

Compliance is demonstrated through:
1. Documentation of initial setup and item selection
2. Records of adjustment cycles and waiting periods
3. Evidence of process monitoring and feedback integration
4. Verification of observable changes between initial and final states
5. Documentation of any iteration cycles required

## Related Information
- Process documentation should be maintained for reference
- Feedback mechanisms should be established for process improvement
- Training materials should emphasize flexibility and intuitive decision-making
