# Flexible Process Management for Iterative Tasks

## Purpose
To provide guidance for managing flexible processes that require iterative adjustments and intuitive decision-making.

## Scope
This rule applies to any process that requires adaptive management and allows for flexible outcomes. It is relevant for all staff members involved in iterative task management.

## Guidelines

### Initial Setup
1. Gather required items selectively
   - Collect essential items only
   - Place items in their preliminary positions
   - Maintain flexibility in arrangement

### Process Execution
1. Initial Assessment
   - Sort items based on intuitive assessment
   - Identify and note any resistance points
   - Allow resistant elements to remain unchanged temporarily

2. Primary Adjustment
   - Apply gentle modifications to main components
   - Implement subtle changes
   - Maintain loose ordering structure

3. Observation Period
   - Allow appropriate interval for process development
   - Conduct periodic checks
   - Make adjustments based on observed progress

4. Adaptation
   - Address missing elements through improvisation
   - Monitor for process indicators (sensory feedback)
   - Maintain flexibility in approach

### Completion Phase
1. Final Adjustments
   - Reverse initial movements gently
   - Allow settling period
   - Conduct final assessment

2. Verification
   - Evaluate changes
   - Repeat earlier steps if needed
   - Trust in process development

## Examples
- When change is observed: Continue with current approach
- When no change is detected: Return to earlier steps and repeat
- When resistance is encountered: Pause and allow time for natural resolution

## Compliance
Compliance is demonstrated through:
1. Appropriate application of flexible methodology
2. Documentation of process adjustments
3. Achievement of desired changes
4. Proper response to process resistance

## Related Information
This procedure emphasizes adaptability and intuitive process management. Success is measured through outcome changes rather than strict adherence to fixed steps.
