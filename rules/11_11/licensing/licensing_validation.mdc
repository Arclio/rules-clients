## Validation Rules
### Revenue Amount
- Minimum: $1,000 (flag if below)
- Maximum: $50,000,000 (flag if above)
- Format: Must be numeric, positive
- Currency: Assume USD unless specified

### Quarter/Year
- Quarter: Must be Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4
- Year: Must be 2020-2030 range
- Format: "Q1 2024" or "2024 Q1"

### Partner Validation
- Must match approved partner list
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handle common variations (Sony vs Sony Music)

## Business Logic
### Duplicate Handling
- Same partner + quarter + year = UPDATE existing record
- Flag significant revenue changes (>50% difference)
- Preserve audit trail of changes

### Quality Scoring
- High confidence (0.9+): All fields extracted cleanly
- Medium confidence (0.7-0.9): Some manual parsing required
- Low confidence (<0.7): Requires human review

## Alert Conditions
- Revenue change >100% from previous quarter
- New partner not in approved list
- Extraction confidence <0.7
- Missing required fields (partner, quarter, revenue)
