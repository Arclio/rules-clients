# Clinical Data Validation Rules

## Pre-Analysis Validation

### Dataset Verification
**MANDATORY CHECKS**:
1. Verify safety population count matches expected enrollment
2. Confirm patient IDs are unique and complete
3. Validate adverse event coding against MedDRA
4. Check grade assignments follow CTCAE v5.0

### Data Quality Gates
**Analysis CANNOT proceed unless**:
- Patient count > 0
- All adverse events have valid MedDRA codes
- All grades are within valid range (1-5)
- No duplicate patient records in safety population

### Population Validation
If `safety_population_count != expected_enrollment`:
  - STOP_ANALYSIS
  - Alert: "Population mismatch detected"
  - Require manual review

If `any_patient_missing_treatment_exposure`:
  - EXCLUDE from safety population
  - Document exclusion rationale

## Statistical Validation

### Incidence Rate Validation
For each adverse event:
  - Calculate `patient_incidence = (patients_with_event / safety_population) Ã— 100`
  
  If `patient_incidence > 100`:
    - ERROR: "Invalid calculation detected"
    - STOP_ANALYSIS
    
  If `sum_of_grade_percentages != total_incidence`:
    - ERROR: "Grade distribution error"
    - REQUIRE_RECALCULATION

### Cross-Validation Checks
- Verify thrombocytopenia + neutropenia rates align with hematologic toxicity profile
- Check that Grade 4-5 events align with serious adverse event rates
- Validate dose modifications correlate with toxicity grades
