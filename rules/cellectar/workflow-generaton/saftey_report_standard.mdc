# Safety Report Generation Standards

## Table 14.3.1: Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events

### Required Table Structure

| System Organ Class                         | Grade 1   | Grade 2   | Grade 3   | Grade 4   | Grade 5   | Any Grade |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Preferred Term**                         | n (%)     | n (%)     | n (%)     | n (%)     | n (%)     | n (%)     |
| Blood and lymphatic system disorders       | XX (XX.X) |           |           |           |           |           |
| Thrombocytopenia                           | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | XX (XX.X) |
| Neutropenia                                | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | XX (XX.X) |
| Anemia                                     | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | X (X.X)   | XX (XX.X) |



### Table Footnotes (Required)
- Safety population: N = [total patients]
- Patients are counted once per preferred term at worst grade
- Grading per CTCAE v5.0
- MedDRA version [X.X] coding

### Report Header Standards

Study: [Protocol Number]
Population: Safety Population (N=[total])
Analysis Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
MedDRA Version: [X.X]
CTCAE Version: 5.0


## Narrative Summary Guidelines

### Executive Summary Format
**Maximum 3 paragraphs**:
1. Overall safety profile summary
2. Most frequent adverse events (â‰¥20% incidence)
3. Serious adverse events and dose modifications

### Key Safety Findings Template
"In the safety population (N=[X]), the most frequently reported adverse events were
hematologic toxicities, with thrombocytopenia occurring in [X]% ([n/N]) of patients
and neutropenia in [X]% ([n/N]) of patients. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities
occurred in [X]% of patients, leading to dose modifications in [X]% of cases."


### Prohibited Language
- "Events occurred" (use "patients experienced")
- "Total number of events" (use "patient incidence")
- "Event rate" (use "incidence rate")
- "Frequency of occurrence" (use "percentage of patients")

## Conditional Content

If `dose_modification_rate > 30%`:
  - Include detailed dose modification analysis table
  
If `treatment_discontinuation_rate > 20%`:
  - Include discontinuation reasons by preferred term
  
If `any_grade_5_events`:
  - Include individual patient narratives
  - Include causality assessment summary

## Quality Check Requirements

### Pre-Release Validation
**MANDATORY CHECKS**:
1. All percentages sum correctly within SOC
2. Patient counts never exceed safety population
3. Grade distribution mathematically consistent
4. No event-level language in patient-level tables
5. Regulatory format compliance verified

### Review Requirements
- Clinical review by qualified physician
- Statistical review by biostatistician  
- Regulatory review for submission compliance
- Data management verification of source data
